# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a code you write that completes an action on an agrument/input based on the parameters you set within your code. You would use a function if you need 
  a reaction to happen based on the value you have the system evaluate to run an action on. 
  

  Researched answer:
  
  A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions have a designated name, a list of parameters enclosed in parenthesis and separated by commas, 
  and a JavaScript statement that defines the function enclosed in curly brackets. A function can be invoked or run when an event occurs (when a user clicks a button), when it is invoked
  or called from prior Javascript code, or invoked automaticaly by itself. A function can be used various times to yielf different results. 


2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .map and .filter are both actions that can access array or objects in different ways. .filter will change the length of the array while .map will keep the integrity and length of the array.

  Researched answer:
  .filter() returns a subset of the elements from the original array, while .map() produces an array with new, different entries based on the elements in the original array.
  The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. The filter method is well suited for particular instances where the user 
  must identify certain items in an array that share a common characteristic.The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The map method allows items 
  in an array to be manipulated to the user’s preference, returning the conclusion of the chosen manipulation in an entirely new array.

3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() is a tool for developers to see the desired result of the code they write. "return" is used in code as a way for the argument to exit the code if it meets the desired
  parameters. Frequently after the word "return" actions are written out in the code as to what should happen to the argument that is entered. 

  Researched answer:
  The console.log() outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string (with optional substitution values), or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects.
  The console.log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.
  The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function.

4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is any data type (boolean, string, number, object etc.) that is entered into a function to be processed by that function. It is the information that the function 
  may or may not act on depending on the parameters set by the programmer writing the code. 

  Researched answer:
  Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair Programming is a very effective learning method that involves 2 programmers working collaboratively together to create effective and functional code. There are two 
  positions the navigator and the driver. The Navigator is the one that uses the mouse and keyboard while the driver is the one who voices out what the navigator should do. When utilizing 
  pair programming it is important for each person to have patience, persistence, an open mind, respect for each other learning process, and teamwork.

  Researched answer:
  Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,
  reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: I do not know what TDD is. 

  Researched answer:
  
  Test-driven development is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code 
  is improved so that the tests pass.Test-Driven Development starts with designing and developing tests for every small functionality of an application. In TDD approach, first, the test is developed 
  which specifies and validates what the code will do. TDD means "Test Driven Development". The primary goal of TDD is to make the code clearer, simple and bug-free.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: 
   Working on this assessment assignment was EXTREMELY helpful. Placing myself in front of an assignment by myself to research all aspects to achieve the code to work was super effective in 
   my learning process. 
   
   I enjoyed working with pairs, sometimes my partner was more experienced then me and I learned alot from them, sometimes I was more experienced than my partner and I could teach them. Both 
   models were very effective for me. The more we can switch pairs the better (at least a new pair each day).
   
   I enjoyed the end of week question wrap up. 
   
   
   



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React
  Your answer:
  I believe it is a programming language or framework created by Facebook.

  Researched answer:
  React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

- Yarn
  Your answer: 
  It is a method of retrieving specific data.
  Researched answer:
  Yarn is a package manager for your code. It allows you to use and share (e.g. JavaScript) code with other developers from around the world.Code is shared through something called a package
  (sometimes referred to as a module). A package contains all the code being shared as well as a package.json file which describes the package.

- React State
  Your answer:
  I don't know what React State is.
  Researched answer:
  The heart of every React component is its “state”, an object that determines how that component renders & behaves. In other words, “state” is what allows you to create components that 
  are dynamic and interactive. Ice to Water analogy where if you change the value of the temperature you can put the ice or water into a different state.

- CRUD
  Your answer: I don't know what CRUD is. 
  Researched answer: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
